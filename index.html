<p>You need a schema for each type of clinical data you want to represent, like blood pressure or body weight. We brought together clinical experts, data scientists, software architects and developers to come up with simple, descriptive schemas for common types of clinical data. You can read up about the schemas on our <a href="http://www.openmhealth.org/developers/schemas/">website</a>, and use our <a href="https://github.com/openmhealth/schemas">schema repository</a> to look at lots of sample data, validate your own data, or create new schemas.</p>

<p>You need to store their data, offer a simple API to let other systems access that data, and support OAuth to let your users authorize access to their data. We've built an <a href="https://github.com/openmhealth/omh-dsu-ri">API endpoint</a> that does all of that and is easy to deploy.</p>

<p>You need to fetch data from those toolmaker APIs and map it to your schemas. We've built <a href="https://github.com/openmhealth/omh-shims">API shims and a shim server</a> that do just that.</p>

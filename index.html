                    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I want to represent health data in a structured way.</h3>

        <p>You need a schema for each type of data you want to represent, like blood pressure or body weight. We've
            brought together top clinical experts, data scientists, developers and software architects to come up with
            simple, extensible, and clinically valid schemas for common types of health data. You can
            <a href="http://www.openmhealth.org/developers/schemas/">browse these schemas</a>,
            <a href="http://www.openmhealth.org/our-approach/clinical-schemas/">learn more about our approach to
                developing them</a>,
            and use our <a href="https://github.com/openmhealth/schemas">schema repository</a> to find sample data,
            validate your own data, or create new schemas.</p>

        <h3>

               href="#i-want-to-let-my-users-share-their-clinical-data" aria-hidden="true"><span
                    class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I want to let my users share their health data with other
            applications.</h3>

        <p>You need to offer a simple API that lets your users authorise access to their data and lets other
            applications retrieve it.
            Our <a href="https://github.com/openmhealth/omh-dsu-ri">DSU
                repository</a> contains an API endpoint that stores health data, implements OAuth 2.0, and is easy to
            deploy.</p>

            <a id="i-want-to-pull-in-structured-data-from-apps-and-devices-like-runkeeper-fitbit-and-jawbone"
               class="anchor"
               href="#i-want-to-pull-in-structured-data-from-apps-and-devices-like-runkeeper-fitbit-and-jawbone"
               aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I want to pull in and process health
            data from apps
            and devices like RunKeeper, Fitbit, and Jawbone.</h3>

        <p>You need to fetch data from those toolmaker APIs and convert it into a common format. This lets your code
             work on the data irrespective of where it came from. It also lets you use third-party code that understands
            the data schemas your data now conforms to. Our <a
                    href="https://github.com/openmhealth/omh-shims">shim repository</a> contains API shims that pull
            data from the leading toolmaker APIs and converts it to match our schemas.</p>

{"name":"Open mHealth on GitHub","tagline":"Bringing clinical meaning to digital health data","body":"### I want to represent clinical data in a structured way.\r\nYou need a schema for each type of clinical data you want to represent, like blood pressure or body weight. We brought together clinical experts, data scientists, software architects and developers to come up with simple, descriptive schemas for common types of clinical data. You can read up about the schemas on our [website](http://www.openmhealth.org/developers/schemas/), and use our [schema repository](https://github.com/openmhealth/schemas) to look at lots of sample data, validate your own data, or create new schemas.\r\n\r\n### I want to let my users share their clinical data.\r\nYou need to store their data, offer a simple API to let other systems access that data, and support OAuth to let your users authorize access to their data. We've built an [API endpoint](https://github.com/openmhealth/omh-dsu-ri) that does all of that and is easy to deploy.\r\n\r\n### I want to pull in structured data from apps and devices like RunKeeper, Fitbit, and Jawbone.\r\nYou need to fetch data from those toolmaker APIs and map it to your schemas. We've built [API shims and a shim server](https://github.com/openmhealth/omh-shims) that do just that.\r\n\r\n### I want a product that pulls in patient data from consumer APIs, processes it, and puts it in front of clinicians.\r\nYou need to talk to us about [Linq](http://www.linqhealth.co/).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
